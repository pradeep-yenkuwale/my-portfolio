  description: "Hi, I'm Pradeep Yenkuwale — a passionate and solution-oriented programmer with a strong focus on JavaScript as my primary technology and Python as a secondary tool in my stack. I specialize in designing and implementing scalable architectural solutions, including both High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD), with hands-on experience in system integration. With a strong self-learning mindset, I constantly explore new technologies and approaches to problem-solving. I enjoy working across the full web development stack, and I’m particularly driven by building clean, efficient, and impactful web applications. I'm open to opportunities that align with my expertise and passion for technology.",
